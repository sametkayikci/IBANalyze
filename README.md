# IBANalyze: Simplifying IBAN Extraction from Images

IBANalyze is a powerful .NET 9 tool designed to automate the process of extracting and validating IBANs (International Bank Account Numbers) from images. By combining OCR (Optical Character Recognition), regex, and validation algorithms, it simplifies what was once a tedious and error-prone task.

## Tesseract Supported Languages

This project supports English, Turkish, Italian, and German by default. If you want to use a different language, you must download the corresponding `.traineddata` file from the list below.

| **Lang Code** | **Language** | **Trained Data** |
|---------------|--------------|------------------|
| eng           | English      | [eng.traineddata](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata/raw/4.00/eng.traineddata) |
| tur           | Turkish      | [tur.traineddata](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata/raw/4.00/tur.traineddata) |
| ita           | Italian      | [ita.traineddata](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata/raw/4.00/ita.traineddata) |
| deu           | German       | [deu.traineddata](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata/raw/4.00/deu.traineddata) |

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sametkayikci/IBANalyze.git
   cd IBANalyze
   ```

2. Ensure you have the following installed:
   - .NET 9 or higher
   - Tesseract OCR with the required `tessdata` files.

3. Restore dependencies and build the project:
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   dotnet build
   ```

4. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   dotnet test
   ```

## Usage

### 1. Configure the IBAN Extractor

Set up the extractor using the builder pattern:

```csharp
var extractor = new IbanalyzeBuilder()
    .SetTessDataPath("./tessdata")
    .SetLanguage("eng+tur")
    .AddImages("invoice1.jpg", "invoice2.jpg")
    .RemoveSpaces(true)
    .Build();
```

### 2. Extract IBANs

Use the extractor to process the images and retrieve validated IBANs:

```csharp
var ibans = extractor.ExtractValidIbans();

foreach (var iban in ibans)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Extracted IBAN: {iban}");
}
```

---

## Testing

IBANalyze includes a comprehensive suite of unit tests to ensure accuracy and robustness. Tests cover:

- Valid and invalid IBANs.
- Handling edge cases like null, empty, or excessively long IBANs.
- Correcting common OCR errors.

Run the tests with:
```bash
dotnet test
```
